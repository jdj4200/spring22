(** * 6.822 Formal Reasoning About Programs, Spring 2022 - Pset 11 *)

Require Import Frap Pset11Sig.

(* Programmers who start programming with threads and locks soon realize that it
 * is tricky to avoid *deadlocks*, where thread #1 is waiting to take a lock
 * held by thread #2, and thread #2 is waiting to take a lock held by thread #3,
 * and... thread #N is waiting to take a lock held by thread #1.  That's a wait
 * cycle, and none of the threads will ever make progress.
 *
 * The most common wisdom about avoiding deadlocks is to impose a *total order*
 * on the locks.  A thread is only allowed to acquire a lock that is *less than*
 * all locks it currently holds.  In this pset, we formalize a simple static
 * analysis checking that the total-order rule is obeyed, and we prove that any
 * program accepted by the analysis avoids deadlock. *)

(* Please start by reading the definitions in Pset11Sig.v! *)

(* Before diving into the proof hacking, it might be helpful to write a short
   sample program (in Coq) where thread 1 acquires lock 1 and then lock 2,
   while thread 2 tries to acquire lock 2 and then lock 1, and explain (in
   English) how a deadlock can happen: *)

Example bad: prog := [x <- Lock 1 ; y <- Lock 2 ; z <- Unlock 2 ; Unlock 1 ;
                      b <- Lock 2 ; b <- Lock 1 ; c <- Unlock 1 ; Unlock 2].
Compute length bad.
(* FILL IN explanation here *)

(* And now, explain why the total-order rule would reject your example by copy-pasting
   the one rule which rejects it from Pset11Sig.v and briefly describing how it would
   reject it: *)

(* FILL IN explanation here *)

(* The two questions above are not graded, but we hope they help you understand
   the material better! *)

(* Since we use the [a_useful_invariant] theorem, proving [deadlock_freedom]
   reduces to proving this lemma â€” the only one in this Pset!  See hints at the bottom
   of the signature file if you get stuck, and of course come to office hours if you 
   have any questions or need help. *)
